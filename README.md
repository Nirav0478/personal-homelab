# My Homelab!

Starting in the Summer of 2024, I have had a personal server made from an old Gateway LX6810 desktop that was previously sitting in my parents' garage. It now serves as a media, backup, and experimentation server that I mess around with every so and then.

## Specifications
- Operating System: Debian 12 Stable
- RAM: 8GB
- Storage: 7TB of HDD space, combined with JBOD
> More details will come soon, as soon as I visit my parents' house to log the rest of the specs!

## Software
- UFW
- Nextcloud
- PiHole
- A Samba share folder

## Potential Improvements
- Use a VPN like Wireguard for remote access
- Set up Nginx or Apache for HTTPS support
- Potentially host a Minecraft Server
